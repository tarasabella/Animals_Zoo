# Zoo Lab

Welcome to your first day as a Flatiron Zookeeper!
Today, we are being asked to create two domain models - a `Zoo` model and an `Animal` model and build out their relationships! Keep in mind that an animal can only be in one location at a time!

Here are some of our deliverables:

## Zoo Class
- A `zoo` should be initialized with a name and a location, which should both be passed as strings.
- `Zoo.all` should return an array of all the zoo instances.
- `Zoo#animals` should return all the animals that a specific instance of zoo has.
- `Zoo#animal_names` should return an array of all the types of the animals in the zoo.
- `Zoo#find_by_type` should take in the animal's type as an argument and return an array of all the animals in that zoo, which are of that type.
- `Zoo.find_by_location` should take in a location as an argument and return an array of all the zoos with that location.

## Animal Class
- An `animal` should be instantiated with the type (e.g. "Cat", "Dog", "Rat") and a numerical weight. Keep in mind that the animal's type should not be able to change, but its weight can.
- `Animal.all` should return an array of all the animal instances.
- `Animal#zoo` should return the zoo instance that the instance belongs to.
- `Animal.find_by_type` should take in an animal's type as an argument and return an array of all the animals, which are of that type.

There are no restrictions and no tests, so it's up to you to decide how to implement this!
